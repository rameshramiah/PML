# Practical Machine Learning Prediction Assignment Writeup

## Background  
  
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement - a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it.  
  
## Project Goal  
  
The goal of this project, is to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants to predict if they performed the activity correctly or incorrectly in 5 different ways (variable "classe"). Class A corresponds to the specified execution of the exercise, while the other 4 classes correspond to common mistakes.
